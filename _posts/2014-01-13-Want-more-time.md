What if I stated I could give you at least one more hour in your day?  What would you do with it?  Would you start a hobby?  Would you read that book that has been on your shelf for three years?  Would you work out, spend more time with your children, learn a new language?  If most of us examine our daily habits, I believe that we actually do have time to do these, but we have to give up the mundane things that are consuming our time today.  

Maybe you could:

- Stop watching junk TV

- Stop spending hours on Facebook or Twitter

- Stop any other online addiction

- Stop _insert your own time waster here_

Now try this:

- Listen to books while driving or on the train

- Get up 15 minutes earlier
