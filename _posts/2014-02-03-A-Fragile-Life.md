[Philip Seymour Hoffman](http://www.npr.org/2014/02/02/270637235/philip-seymour-hoffman-an-uncanny-actor-of-stage-and-screen "Philip Seymour Hoffman Passes") died the other day.  What a tragedy. It reminds me of just how fragile our lives can be, that it only takes a small broken shoelace that starts us on the road to ruin.  Letting those little things add up in our lives can whittle away at you.  It begins to degrade your hopes, your desires, your belief that you are an awesome wonderful child of God that can accomplish anything.  

I know of a woman that after her father died began believing all of those bad thoughts.  She listened to that reptilian brain and began believing that she was nothing and that drugs were going to make it all better.  The voice she didn't listen to was the voice of her husband who told her he loved her and that her two children needed her. That she didn't have to do those things and that he was there for her.  Last I heard, she was still on the path to ruin.  

Don't let that happen to you.  FIGHT BACK.  If those voices in your head are telling you, you are not worth anything.  Don't listen.  Call a friend, go to church, pray, go for a walk, exercise, do something - anything.  Once you begin to listen to all of the things that are wrong with you, that you are doing wrong, you start to believe.  DON'T.  

God made you in his image.  Embrace it, love it and don't ever give up.  It is worth fighting for.
